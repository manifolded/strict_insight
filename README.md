# strict_insight
This is one of a series of repos hosting experiments I've done trying to build a camera app.  While my own camera app is still a work in progress, this repo has been largely abandoned.  Never the less, you might be surprised to find yourself interested in this source anyway.  

## The Rationale
The official Android CameraX basic examples files are really clunky.  These are a great improvement.  In particular, if you are interested in writing an `ImageAnalyzer` this repo contains one of the few examples out there showing how to do so.

## Installation and Testing
If you've come this far you're probably already have [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed.  If not, you'll surely need it.

With your AS install open your clone of this repo and click the build button in the toolbar; it has a hammer on it.

I have a Google Pixel 2 solely for the purpose of testing camera app code.  An emulator is a very unsatisfying way of testing camera apps.

## A Fond Farewell
This particular repo was only abandoned when the experiments started to require code that needed to be kept private.  

It has been replaced by lumiCenterTestBed, a private repo,  which has in turn been replaced by sensible-detachment which is also private.
