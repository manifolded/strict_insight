This is one of a series of repos hosting experiments I did to try and get a idea up for an Android camera app up and running.  This particularly repo has fallen dormant because it is based on the Android CameraX library which (as of April 2020) does not allow for the raw camera data access I need.

It is replaced by lumiCenterTestBed, which is also CameraX-based, and was also eventually replaced.
